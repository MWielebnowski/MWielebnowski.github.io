## Welcome to my GitHub page

I made this page to show off some of my projects as part of my portfolio, unfotunately I decided to document them back in 2019, so most of them are lost in the void of time.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/MWielebnowski/MWielebnowski.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
